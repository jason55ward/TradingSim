Trading Simulator
Simple chart rendering app with ability to load data files and allow trading with manual chart scrolling

Software needed to run it is in requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to use it:
Run main.py

About the app:
It runs manually with arrow keys and it simply draws the next bar
The purpose is to practice trading, adding to positions and taking losses.
I haven't come across a tool that does this to the level I want and I also wanted more control over my testing process.

This code isn't perfect and this is by no means a complete project.
You may adapt this code and do what you wish with it.
